Lab Exercises
1.	Create a list of 6 integers. Print the list, its length, and the sum of all elements. Replace the third element with its square, append a new number, and sort the list in descending order.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Length of list:", len(numbers))
print("Sum of elements:", sum(numbers))

numbers[2] = numbers[2] ** 2
print("After squaring 3rd element:", numbers)

numbers.append(7)
print("After appending :", numbers)

numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print("Sorted in descending order:", numbers)
 
2.	Create a tuple containing 5 colors. Print the tuple and access the second and last elements. Unpack the tuple into variables and print them. Try to modify an element and explain the error in a comment.

colors=("red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "black")
print("Tuple of colors:", colors)
print("Second element:", colors[1])
print("Last element:", colors[-1])

c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 = colors
print("Unpacked values:", c1, c2, c3, c4, c5)

colors[0] = "Orange"  #TypeError: tuples are immutable
 
3.	Create two sets: one with numbers 1 to 5 and another with 4 to 8. Compute and print their union, intersection, and difference. Add a new number to the first set and remove one from the second, handling potential errors.

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

print("Set 1:", set1)
print("Set 2:", set2)

print("Union:", set1 | set2)
print("Intersection:", set1 & set2)
print("Difference (set1 - set2):", set1 - set2)

set1.add(10)
print("After adding 10 to set1:", set1)

set2.discard(8)
print("After trying to remove 8 from set2:", set2)
 
4.	Create a dictionary for a book with keys: title, author, year, and genres (a list of strings). Update the year to 2023, add a key for ISBN, and remove the genres key. Print all keys and values separately.
book={
    "Tittle":"The true Leader",
    "Author":"Noman Tariq",
    "year": 1935,
    "genres":["Leadership of Imran Khan"]
    }
book["year"] = 2023
book["ISBN"] = "123456789"
del book["genres"]

for key,value in book.items():
 print(f"{key}:{value}")
 
5.	Create a dictionary where each value is a list of 3 items (e.g., student names to their grades). Convert one list to a tuple and another to a set. Print the modified dictionary and check if a specific item exists in one of the collections.

students = {
    "d1": ["farhan", "A", 9282],
    "d2": ["Noman", "B", 9702],
    "d3": ["Tasaddaq", "C", 9569]
}

students["d1"] = tuple(students["d1"])
students["d2"] = set(students["d2"])

print("\nDictionary:")
print(students)
if"farhan" in students["d1"]:
    print("\nfarhan exists")
else:
    print("\nfarhan doesnot exist")

if "B" in students["d2"]:
    print("Nouman has B grade")
else:
    print("Nouman does not have B grade")
